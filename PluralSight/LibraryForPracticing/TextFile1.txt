F# Jumpstart notes

F# is a CLI language which can be developed or ran on .NET
Visual studio provides an IDE and compiler as well as an interactive environment for development called
F# interactive

syntax 
let Area x y = 
	x * y

let defines values and functions
functions return result of last expression
indentions used instead of {} curly braces

You do not necessarily have to specify the types for your functions because of type inference
if you want to force types specify the type after a colon for the type involved

let CircleArea (r : float) =
	if r > 0. then
		System.Math.PI * r * r
	else
		0.0

if expressions generally return values so unless your working through side effects you generally have to have
an else branch with every if

for loops let you iterate across ranges of values

Array module HOF (higher order functions)
.init for creating an array with a function
.filter for picking out particular elements
.map for applying a function to generate another array
