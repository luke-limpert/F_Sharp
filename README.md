# F_Sharp
Repository for F Sharp Projects

Projects are made with reference to "Expert F# 4.0" by Don Syme, Adam Granicz, and Antonio Cisternino.

An outline of the projects that will be placed in their respective folders corresponding to the chapters.

The main reason for choosing this book as reference and learning material is a recommendation by Kit Eason.
I watched a few of his courses on PluralSight and read a few articles he was mentioned in.
